Once a new ticket is created, you’ll see sections for Contact Information, Help Topic, and Ticket Details. This is where end users provide the necessary information about their issue. For this example, let’s take on the role of Karen Blaese, reporting a widespread issue where users across the nation are unable to log into the mobile app.

After submitting the ticket regarding the mobile app lockout, this is what the Support Desk Technician sees. All the details Karen provided are displayed clearly, ensuring the technician has the information needed to start troubleshooting.

Here, you can observe the updates made to Karen’s ticket. John, the technician, assigned the ticket to himself, adjusted the SLA, and modified the ticket's priority level to ensure the issue receives prompt attention. He then responds to Karen, reassuring her that the team is actively working to resolve the mobile app issue.
